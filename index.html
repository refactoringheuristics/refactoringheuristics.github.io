        Structural degradation is the process in which quality attributes of a system are negatively impacted. Examples of such quality attributes are readability, modifiability, and extensibility. When due attention is not paid to structural degradation, the source code may become difficult to change. Code smells are recurring structures in the source code that may represent structural degradation. Thus, there are many catalogs and techniques for supporting the removal of code smells through refactoring recommendations. Such recommendations usually consist of single refactorings. However, there is evidence that single refactorings are not enough for completely removing smells. Moreover, recent studies show that developers often apply composite refactorings -- i.e., sequences of two or more refactorings -- for removing code smells. Despite showing the importance of performing composite refactorings, existing studies do not provide information on which composite refactoring patterns are recurrent in practice. Therefore, in this work, we conducted an empirical study to extract data from multiple open source systems regarding the composite refactoring practice. This data helped us to find 35 recurring patterns that are effective in removing certain types of code smells. Based on such patterns, we propose a suite of new recommendation heuristics to help developers in applying effective composite refactorings. These heuristics are intended to remove three code smell types, namely Complex Class, Feature Envy, and God Class. After designing the heuristics, we evaluated their effectiveness through a quasi-experiment. This evaluation was conducted with 12 software developers and 9 smelly classes. Results indicate that developers considered our heuristics effective or partially effective in more than 93% of the cases. In addition, the evaluation revealed multiple factors that contribute to the acceptance or rejection of refactoring recommendations.
